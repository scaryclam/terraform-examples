# This is a sample set of files for creating an ECS cluster with and ASG and task definition.

By default, the example just starts a redis container in ECS with no ports mapped.

You can run a different container by setting the `repo_url` and `task_version` to something of your choosing.

You'd want to also create your own container definition if you want this example to be more useful to you than the tiny sample one provided here.
