# terraform-examples

This is a repository for both simple and more complex Terraform examples. The purpose is to help build up a set of sample code that can be mixed and matched to create infrastructure, or to just help people learn more about how to use Terraform in a practical manner.

Each example should either be:

 * very simple so as to make it as understandable as possible and leave it open enough for someone to use as boilerplate and extend for their own usage.
 * build upon a previous example to show how to do something more complicated, but with the simpler versions as references
 * Documented with comments where something may be confusing

Examples can contain more than required for the exact topic, but additional resources should have comments to show that they are not required
Examples should **NOT** use modules or shortcuts unless the purpose of the example is to demonstrate modules or shortcuts!
